# Recommendation_Systems
Using movies as a case study, This repository showcases two distinct approaches to building recommendation systems:

Collaborative Filtering: Leveraging user-item interactions to suggest movies based on collective preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Utilizing movie attributes to recommend titles tailored to individual tastes.
Both methods are implemented in separate notebooks, providing clear and concise workflows for each approach.
